This is a website I am currently making for the Western Washington University Swing kids club.
At the moment it is a work in progress.
Currently only the home page has been partially implemented.
There is currently a scrolling banner at the head of the page, as well as a navigation bar which is still in the works.
All my time and energy up till now has been getting the banner to work. More to come.
